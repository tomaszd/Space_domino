Universal Checker to checkif Domino Of Words is possiible to be created. Fun project


"""
In a distant galaxy, there are people playing cosmic dominoes. Each domino consists of any number of fields (at least one), where each field can contain any small letter of the alphabet (from 'a' to 'z'). The main aim of the game is to put all the dominoes in the order that for each domino (not first), the first field, was equal to the last box of the previous domino. Dominoes cannot be rotated (must always have the same beginning and end).
 
Create a program which for the particular dominoes will check whether the game can be solved so that all the dominoes are arranged in the correct order.
 
Input: N dominoes separated by the sign of a new line (1 <= N <= 100 000).
 
Output: If the game can be solved  - yes, If not: no
 
Example 1:
 
Input:
 
teodor
 
basia
 
albert
 
Output:
Yes
 
 
Example 2:
 
Input:
 
ratusz
 
mysz
 
 
Output:
No
